Hello,

This is seemingly the trickiest item to submit. The video size is 54mb and github only allows files that are 25mb or smaller. I was able to get a copy uploaded in 2SU.
I recorded the video via my work Zoom account, which does not allow for me to share the link with people outside of our company/those with access to our intranet.

Let me know if you have any issues seeing the uploaded video and we can try to find some sort of solution. Thanks!
