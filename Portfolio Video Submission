The link below should take you to my video submission. The total size was 55mb so I was unable to load the file itself into github. 

Let me know if you run into any issues and I'll be happy to find another way to get the file over.

Hello,

This is seemingly the trickiest item to submit. The video size is 54mb. I recorded the video via my work Zoom account, which does not allow for me to share the link with people outside of our company/those with access to our intranet.

Let me know if you have any issues seeing the uploaded video and we can try to find some sort of solution. Thanks!
Jeremiah
